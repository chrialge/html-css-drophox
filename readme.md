# Dropbox Layout

link of the site

This is a landing page where I practiced reproducing a facsimile of the Dropbox page. The project is made simply with `HTML` and `CSS` (with just a few lines of JavaSCRIPT ðŸ˜ˆ), I recreated the homepage with a laptopFirst approach to make it responsive, I implemented animations and a dropdown menu to improve user experience, and when you click on `inizio/prova gratis`, it takes you to the registration page that I also created with `HTML` and `CSS`.
